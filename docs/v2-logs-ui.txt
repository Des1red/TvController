UI Update — Interactive TUI Configuration (v2)

A new terminal-based UI (TUI) was added to replace manual flag entry with a structured, interactive configuration flow.

What’s new:

    Mode-based configuration (Auto / Stream / Scan / Manual / Cache)

    Editable fields mapped directly from existing flags

    Keyboard navigation (↑ ↓ Enter Esc)

    Clear separation between mode selection and configuration

    Mode-specific field sets (only relevant options shown)

    Readable, centered layout with consistent styling

UX improvements:

    Mode descriptions shown during selection

    Mode-specific execute labels for clarity

    Confirmation screen before execution

    Conditional greyed-out fields for dependent options

    Transaction-style config editing using a working copy (safe cancel / commit)

    One-time startup animation for visual polish

Design goals:

    Reduce mistakes caused by long flag lists

    Improve clarity without adding complexity

    No changes to execution logic — UI is a thin, safe layer
